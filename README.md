# COVID-19 Mortality Data Analysis 🦠📊

This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19-related mortality data using SQL. The dataset includes confirmed death counts from the pandemic. It provides insight into the global death toll, acknowledging the underestimation of official figures due to factors such as limited testing, death registry inconsistencies, and challenges in determining the exact cause of death.

Additionally, we analyze "excess mortality" data 💀📈, which accounts for the broader impact of the pandemic. We consider factors like disruptions in health services and the indirect effects of COVID-19. This exploration aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the global death toll during the COVID-19 pandemic.
